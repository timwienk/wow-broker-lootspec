Broker: LootSpec
================

Simple loot specialisation display with specialisation selection in its
tooltip.

**Requires a LibDataBroker [Display Addon][], like [StatBlockCore][] or
[ElvUI][].**

Also known as:

- Broker\_LootSpec
- Broker: Loot Specialisation
- Broker: Loot Specialization

Features
--------

- Displays the currently active loot specialisation
- Adds an asterisk (\*) when loot specialisation is in the default
  "current specialisation" mode
- Mouse-over tooltip to change the loot specialisation
- Left click toggles tooltip for loot specialisation changing as well,
  for those who have mouseover tooltips disabled in combat
- Right click to toggle the [Dungeon Journal][]
- When clicked and the [Dungeon Journal][] is opened, filters are set
  for the selected loot specialisation and dungeon you are in
- When switching loot specialisation while the [Dungeon Journal][] is
  open, filters and dungeon are set as well

Notes
-----

- There is no configuration (since there is nothing to configure)
- Looks (icon display, font and the like) depend on the
  [Display Addon][] you use

lot to translate.
