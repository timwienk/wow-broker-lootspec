Broker\_LootSpec
================

Simple loot specialisation display with specialisation selection in its
tooltip.

**Requires a LibDataBroker [Display Addon][].**

Features
--------

- Displays the currently active loot specialisation
- Adds an asterisk (\*) when loot specialisation is in the default
  "current specialisation" mode
- Tooltip to change the loot specialisation
- Left click to toggle the [Dungeon Journal][] or [Atlas Loot][] if
  available
- Right click always toggles the [Dungeon Journal][]
- When clicked and the [Dungeon Journal][] is opened, filters are set
  for the selected loot specialisation and dungeon you are in
- When switching loot specialisation while the [Dungeon Journal][] is
  open, filters and dungeon are set as well

Notes
-----
- There is no configuration (since there is nothing to configure)
- Looks (icon display, font and the like) depend on the
  [Display Addon][] you use

Localisation
------------

You can [help localise][] this addon. Fortunately there is really not a
lot to translate.
